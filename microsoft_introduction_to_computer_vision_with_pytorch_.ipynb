    "## Computer Vision. Images as Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer Vision (CV) is a field that studies how computers can gain some degree of understanding from digital images and/or video. *Understanding* in this definition has a rather broad meaning - it can range from being able to distinguish between a cat and a dog on the picture, to more complex tasks such as describing the image in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common problems of computer vision include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Image Classification** is the simplest task, when we need to classify an image into one of many pre-defined categories, for example, distinguish a cat from a dog on a photograph, or recognize a handwritten digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Object Detection** is a bit more difficult task, in which we need to find known objects on the picture and localize them, that is, return the **bounding box** for each of recognized objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Segmentation** is similar to object detection, but instead of giving bounding box we need to return an exact pixel map outlining each of the recognized objects.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Image taken from [CS224d Stanford Course](https://cs224d.stanford.edu/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll focus on **image classification** task, and how neural networks can be used to solve it. As with any other machine learning tasks, to train a model for classifying images we’ll need a labeled dataset, that is, a large number of images for each of the classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Images as Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer Vision works with Images. As you probably know, images consist of pixels, so they can be thought of as a rectangular collection (array) of pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this tutorial, we will deal with handwritten digit recognition. We will use the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits, 28x28 pixels. Each image can be represented as 28x28 array, and elements of this array would denote intensity of corresponding pixel - either in the scale of range 0 to 1 (in which case floating point numbers are used), or 0 to 255 (integers). A popular python library called `numpy` is often used with computer vision tasks, because it allows to operate with multidimensional arrays effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with color images, we need some way to represent colors. In most cases, we represent each pixel by 3 intensity values, corresponding to Red (R), Green (G) and Blue (B) components. This color encoding is called RGB, and thus color image of size $W\\times H$ will be represented as an array of size $3\\times H\\times W$ (sometimes the order of components might be different, but the idea is the same).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Grayscale Image](images/2-image-data-2.png) | ![RGB Image](images/2-image-data-3.png)\n",
    "------|------\n",
    "5x5 Grayscale Image | 5x5 Color (RGB) Image\n",
    "\n",
    "Using multi-dimensional arrays to represent images also has an advantage, because we can use an extra dimension to store a sequence of images. For example, to represent a video fragment consisting of 200 frames with 800x600 dimension, we may use the tensor of size 200x3x600x800.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-dimensional arrays are also called **tensors**. Usually, we refer to tensors when we speak about some neural network framework, such as PyTorch. The main difference between tensors in PyTorch and numpy arrays is that tensors support parallel operations on GPU, if it is available. Also, PyTorch offers additional functionality, such as automatic differentiation, when operating on tensors.  \n",

    "\n",
    "One of the ways to do that is to use one of the Python libraries for image manipulation, such as *Open CV*, or *PIL/Pillow*, or *imageio*. Once you load your image into numpy array, you can easily convert it to tensors. \n",
    "\n",
    "> <font color=\"red\">It is important to make sure that all values are scaled to the range [0..1] before you pass them to a neural network - it is the usual convention for data preparation, and all default weight initializations in neural networks are designed to work with this range. </font>`ToTensor` transform that we have seen above automatically scales PIL/numpy images with integer pixel values into [0..1] range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even better approach is to use functionality in **Torchvision** library, namely `ImageFolder`. It does all the preprocessing steps automatically, and also assigns labels to images according to the directory structure. We will see the example of using `ImageFolder` later in this course, once we start classifying our own cats and dogs images.\n",

    "\n",
    "A basic **neural network** in PyTorch consists of a number of **layers**. The simplest network would include just one fully-connected layer, which is called **Linear** layer, with 784 inputs (one input for each pixel of the input image) and 10 outputs (one output for each class).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"A graph showing how an image is broken into layers based on the pixels.\" src=\"images/3-train-dense-neural-networks-1.png\" width=\"60%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed above, the dimension of our digit images is $1\\times28\\times28$, i.e. each image contains $28\\times28=784$ different pixels. Because linear layer expects its input as one-dimensional vector, we need to insert another layer into the network, called **Flatten**, to change input tensor shape from $1\\times28\\times28$ to $784$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After `Flatten`, there is a main linear layer (called `Dense` in PyTorch terminology) that converts 784 inputs to 10 outputs - one per class. We want $n$-th output of the network to return the probability of the input digit being equal to $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the output of a fully-connected layer is not normalized to be between 0 and 1, it cannot be thought of as probability. Moreover, if want outputs to be probabilities of different digits, they all need to add up to 1. To turn output vectors into probability vector, a function called **Softmax** is often used as the last activation function in a classification neural network. For example, $\\mathrm{softmax}([-1,1,2]) = [0.035,0.25,0.705]$.\n",
